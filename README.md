### üîç Project Overview

- **Web Portal**: Developed a user-friendly interface using Python Flask that allows users to upload sales data files.
- **Cloud Storage**: Uploaded files are securely stored in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.
- **Cloud Function**: A serverless function is automatically triggered when a new file is uploaded. It extracts the data and loads it into BigQuery.
- **ETL Workflow**: Implemented an efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process that handles raw data and prepares it for analysis.
- **Reporting & Dashboards**: Key metrics are visualized through interactive dashboards in Looker Studio, with filtering and drill-down features for deeper insights.
